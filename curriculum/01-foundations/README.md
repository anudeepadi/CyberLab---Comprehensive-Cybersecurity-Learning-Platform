# Module 01: Foundations of Cybersecurity

Welcome to the Foundations module of CyberLab! This module provides the essential building blocks you need before diving into hands-on security testing and exploitation techniques. Whether you're completely new to cybersecurity or transitioning from another IT field, this module will establish the core competencies required for success.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Navigate and operate efficiently in Linux-based operating systems
- Execute complex command-line operations with confidence
- Understand fundamental networking concepts including TCP/IP, OSI model, and common protocols
- Use essential security tools including nmap, netcat, and Wireshark
- Set up and manage the CyberLab Docker-based learning environment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Basic computer literacy**: Familiarity with using a computer, installing software, and navigating file systems
- **Internet access**: Stable connection for downloading tools and accessing resources
- **Curiosity and patience**: Cybersecurity requires a methodical, persistent approach to problem-solving
- **Hardware requirements**:
  - Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
  - 50GB free disk space
  - Intel/AMD x64 or Apple Silicon processor

No prior programming or security experience is required - we'll build from the ground up.

## Module Structure

### Lab 1: Linux Basics
**Duration:** 1-2 hours | **Difficulty:** Beginner

Master the fundamentals of Linux operating systems, the platform of choice for security professionals. Learn file system navigation, user management, and essential system concepts.

[Start Linux Basics](./01-linux-basics/README.md)

---

### Lab 2: Command Line Mastery
**Duration:** 2-3 hours | **Difficulty:** Beginner

Develop proficiency with the command-line interface (CLI). Master file operations, text processing, permissions, and pipeline operations that form the backbone of security workflows.

[Start Command Line Mastery](./02-command-line-mastery/README.md)

### Lab 4: Security Tools Introduction
**Duration:** 2-3 hours | **Difficulty:** Beginner

Get hands-on with essential security tools: nmap for network discovery, netcat for network communication, and Wireshark for packet analysis.

[Start Security Tools Intro](./04-security-tools-intro/README.md)

---

### Lab 5: Lab Environment Setup
**Duration:** 1-2 hours | **Difficulty:** Beginner

Set up the complete CyberLab environment using Docker. Learn to manage containers, verify services, and troubleshoot common issues.

[Start Lab Environment Setup](./05-lab-environment-setup/README.md)

## Assessment Criteria

You're ready to move to the next module when you can:

- [ ] Navigate the Linux file system without using a GUI
- [ ] Write basic shell scripts combining multiple commands
- [ ] Explain the difference between TCP and UDP
- [ ] Perform a basic nmap scan and interpret results
- [ ] Start and stop CyberLab Docker containers
- [ ] Capture and filter packets in Wireshark

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **Complete labs sequentially** - Each lab builds on concepts from previous ones
2. **Practice actively** - Don't just read; type every command yourself
3. **Take notes** - Document commands and concepts that are new to you
4. **Experiment** - Try variations of commands to deepen understanding
5. **Use the hints** - When stuck, hints are designed to guide without giving away answers
